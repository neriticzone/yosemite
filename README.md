# yosemite
Web scraper that checks three yosemite valley campsites (upper/lower/north pintes) and sees if there is availablility for a given date/time. 

test_runnner runs the scraper and emailer. script runs continuously, scheduled to run every hour. Checks port to see if its running or not. I don't really understand it but it works.

campsite_public file contains the scraper and inserts into a database 

sendmail_public has a query that matches user requests with available sites 

i changed capmpsite and sendmail to XXX_public so i wouldn't paste something my code with all my passwords in it :)
